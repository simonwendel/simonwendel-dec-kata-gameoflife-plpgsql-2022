# Postlife - A Tricky-To-Develop GameOfLife on top of PostgreSQL

GameOfLife is an awesome thing, this is a not as awesome implementation using some na√Øve PL/pgSQL code. It's of course
all developed using TDD, because that's the modern way to code\*!

## Run environment

* Docker Desktop or Docker Engine

## How to use

1. Do a quick `docker compose up -d` to start PostgreSQL
2. Run `install-pgtap.sh` to install unit testing framework into PostgreSQL
3. Issue `postlife.sql` followed by `postlife_tests.sql` and...
4. Be amazed at the test results!
5. Success!
